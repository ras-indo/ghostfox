AI agents get blocked. Headless Chrome triggers Cloudflare 403s on ~20% of the
web, and hosted "stealth browsers" route your agent's cookies, identities and
sessions through someone else's cloud.

Ghostfox is the alternative: a **complete browser stack you run yourself** —
a fingerprint-coherent stealth engine plus a Rust MCP runtime, in one repo.

```
Firefox (MPL-2.0)
  └─ Camoufox (anti-detect patches, by daijro)
       └─ Ghostfox engine          engine/   — spoofing at the C++ level
            └─ Ghostfox runtime     runtime/  — Rust: sessions, identities, MCP
```

| | Ghostfox | Hosted stealth (Browserbase etc.) | playwright-mcp | Anti-detect suites (Multilogin etc.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self-hosted | **✓** | ✗ | ✓ | partially |
| Open source | **✓** | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| MCP-native | **✓** | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Engine-level anti-detect | **✓ (C++/Firefox)** | vendor partnerships | ✗ | ✓ (closed) |
| Coherent identities + auditor | **✓** | ✗ | ✗ | partial |
| Runtime language | **Rust** | — | Node | — |

**Captcha suite — 8 families, solved on-device (v0.6.7+).** The runtime
ships native MCP solvers with local models — no paid captcha farms, no
cloud, no browser rent:

| Family | Native tool | How |
|---|---|---|
| GeeTest slide / v4 radar | `page_geetest_slide` | bg-vs-fullbg diff + largest-blob gap detection |
| GeeTest icon-click (文字点选) | `page_geetest_click` | custom-trained YOLOv8s + siamese similarity (rten, CPU) |
| Rotate | `page_captcha_rotate` | 24-angle sweep + programmatic verdict |
| Normal OCR | `page_captcha_ocr` | ported ddddocr (CRNN+LSTM, onnxruntime) |
| hCaptcha | `page_hcaptcha` | layout router + 553-model QIN2DIM zoo + optional vision-model ensemble |
| Cloudflare Turnstile / TikTok | `captcha_solve` + behavioral recipes | proven playbooks in `AGENTS.md` §6b–6e |

E2E-verified against production sites (not vendor demos): bilibili
icon-click ×6 "Verification Succeeded", hCaptcha on real signups
(dashboard.hcaptcha.com, dosya.co), TikTok OAuth+OTP live session.

**Debug cortex — page tools that tell you WHY (v0.7).** Agents stop
guessing when a page misbehaves:

- `page_console` — every `console.log/warn/error` since load
- `page_errors` — uncaught JS exceptions with stack traces
- `page_network_start/read/body` — request/response capture with body fetch

That's the DevTools trio, exposed over MCP.

**Multi-model vision (optional).** `page_vision` + `page_ocr` +
`page_match_image` + `page_pixels` + `page_contrast` — wire any
vision-capable model (Cloudflare Workers AI, GLM, Qwen, ...) as
cross-checks for grid puzzles and layout questions. Keys are optional;
the native solvers above run fully local.

**Eyes for agents — `page_a11y`.** One call returns every visible interactive
element with a stable ref, semantic role, accessible name, live value —
**piercing shadow DOM and same-origin iframes**, so web-component UIs
(Reddit, modern frameworks) are fully visible. Invisible text planted in
names/values (`font-size:0`, `opacity:0`, `aria-hidden`) is **stripped
before the agent sees it** (prompt-injection defense) and reported via
`stripped`/`stripped_content`. The snapshot also reports
**`login_state`** (logged-in / logged-out / unknown), page URL and title —
agents check session health before acting, not after failing.

Agents act by ref: `page_click_ref e38`, `page_type_ref e21 "text"` — no CSS
selectors needed. Rich editors (Lexical, Draft, ProseMirror) are handled via
editor-native input paths with fire-then-verify receipts. `page_wait_for`
replaces manual sleeps. `page_read_ref` gives full untruncated values.
`page_upload_file` bypasses native file pickers.

**Android personas too** — `session_create {"platform": "android"}` gives
portrait screens, Adreno/Mali GPUs, Android font stacks and Firefox-on-Android
UAs, all audited like desktop identities (500/500 coherent, see
[runtime/docs](runtime/docs/benchmark-2026-09-08.md)).

**One identity, no contradictions.** Identities are generated from coherent
device presets (platform, screen, GPU, fonts that actually ship together),
injected at the engine level, and audited before use — a spoofed browser's
worst enemy is itself saying "4 cores on a MacBook".

## Quickstart

Pick a distribution:

```bash
# Python (Linux x86_64)
pip install ghostfox
python -c "import ghostfox; ghostfox.install_engine(); ghostfox.install_runtime()"

# npm / any MCP host
npm install -g ghostfox        # or: npx ghostfox install
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghostcloak": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "ghostfox", "mcp"] }
  }
}

# Docker (engine + MCP runtime, ubuntu:24.04 base)
docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/ras-indo/ghostfox:v0.7.2
# or one-line install of the binary stack:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ras-indo/ghostfox/main/install.sh | bash
```

Also listed on the official
[MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/servers/io.github.ras-indo/ghostfox)
(`io.github.ras-indo/ghostfox`) — one-click add in registry-aware clients.

From source:

```bash
# 1) Get the engine (prebuilt) and unpack it somewhere, e.g. /opt
unzip ghostfox-<ver>-lin.x86_64.zip -d /opt/ghostfox

# 2) Build the runtime
git clone https://github.com/ras-indo/ghostfox.git
cd ghostfox/runtime
cargo build --release
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghostcloak": {
      "command": "/path/to/ghostfox/runtime/target/release/ghostcloak-mcp",
      "env": { "GHOSTFOX_HOME": "/opt/ghostfox" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then the agent can: `session_create` → `page_open` → **`page_a11y`** → act by ref.

**Portable sessions.** `session_create` accepts `profile_dir` for persistent
profiles: cookies, storage and the identity TOML live together in one place,
so a login survives restarts. Migrating a session from another
Camoufox-lineage browser? Copy the cookies and **match the identity to the
origin device** (platform, timezone, locale, screen) — a session that
suddenly changes identity looks like an impossible login and anti-fraud
systems revoke it. Proven flow, see `AGENTS.md` §8.

**Full tool surface (43 tools):**

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Session** | `session_create` · `session_pages` · `session_me` |
| **See** | `page_a11y` (semantic + login_state + shadow DOM/iframe) · `page_snapshot` · `page_screenshot` · `page_read_ref` (full value) |
| **Wait** | `page_wait_for` (poll for a selector) · `page_wait_for_text` (poll for content) · `page_wait_rate_limit` (wait out throttling) · `page_dismiss_modal` |
| **Act** | `page_click_ref` · `page_type_ref` · `page_click` (±`button:"right"` contextmenu, `click_count:2` double-click — real mouse events) · `page_type` · `page_fill` · `page_press` · `page_drag` · `page_move_to` · `page_upload_file` · `page_init_script` |
| **Captcha** | `captcha_solve` · `page_geetest_slide` · `page_geetest_click` · `page_captcha_rotate` · `page_captcha_ocr` · `page_hcaptcha` |
| **Debug** | `page_console` · `page_errors` · `page_network_start` · `page_network_read` · `page_network_body` |
| **Vision** | `page_vision` · `page_ocr` · `page_match_image` · `page_pixels` · `page_contrast` |
| **Inspect** | `page_eval` (one expression) · `browser_exec` (full program + queued goto/click/new_tab, persistent `ns`) · `page_open` · `page_comment` |
| **Identity** | `identity_generate` · `identity_audit` |
| **Evidence & safety** | `session_evidence` · `confirm_action` |

Every mutation returns a **receipt** — `page_fill` reports `landed_chars`, while
`type_ref` fire-then-verifies async editors, so a silent page swap can't eat an
edit unnoticed. Sessions can also run **headful** (`{"headful": true}`) when
humans want to watch the agent work.

**Every run records evidence.** Each session writes an append-only event log
(`events.jsonl`), full page snapshots and the identity it used under
`~/.ghostfox/recordings/` — fetch it any time with `session_evidence`.

**Or install in one command** (Linux x86_64):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ras-indo/ghostfox/main/install.sh | bash
```

From source end-to-end (build the engine yourself):
see [engine/README.md](engine/README.md) — `make dir && make build`.

## MCP transports

Ghostfox ships **two** MCP transports on the same binary — stdio (default,
unchanged) and Streamable HTTP (opt-in) — both exposing the exact same
42-tool surface.

### stdio (default — backward compatible)

```bash
ghostcloak-mcp
```

Stdio mode is unchanged from previous releases: MCP messages on stdout,
logs on stderr. Existing MCP client configs keep working.

### Streamable HTTP

```bash
ghostcloak-mcp --transport http
# or via config:  [server] transport = "http"
```

Listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp` by default.

Client configuration (Claude Code `.mcp.json`, Cursor, opencode, …):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghostfox-http": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

The API key is auto-generated on first start (256-bit random, stored in
`~/.ghostfox/config.toml` with `0600` permissions) or set explicitly — see
below.

### both (stdio + HTTP in one process)

```bash
ghostcloak-mcp --transport both
```

Both transports share the same `GhostcloakServer` state: one trust domain
per process. All authenticated HTTP clients are inside that process's trust
boundary.

## Configuration

Config file default: `~/.ghostfox/config.toml` (override with
`GHOSTFOX_CONFIG=/path/to/config.toml`). Parent dir is created with safe
permissions if missing.

```toml
[server]
transport = "stdio"          # stdio | http | both

[http]
host = "127.0.0.1"           # default localhost — see security note below
port = 8787
endpoint = "/mcp"
api_key = ""                 # empty → auto-generate 256-bit random key
allowed_origins = []         # e.g. ["http://localhost:3000"]
```

Precedence (deterministic): **CLI > ENV > FILE > DEFAULT**

| Setting | Env var | CLI flag |
|---|---|---|
| Config path | `GHOSTFOX_CONFIG` | `--config` |
| Transport | `GHOSTFOX_TRANSPORT` | `--transport` |
| HTTP host | `GHOSTFOX_HTTP_HOST` | `--http-host` |
| HTTP port | `GHOSTFOX_HTTP_PORT` | `--http-port` |
| HTTP endpoint | `GHOSTFOX_HTTP_ENDPOINT` | `--http-endpoint` |
| API key | `GHOSTFOX_HTTP_API_KEY` | `--http-api-key` |
| Allowed origins | `GHOSTFOX_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) | — |

Invalid values (bad port, unknown transport, malformed TOML, invalid origin
list) fail with a clear error at startup; a bad value in a *reloaded* file is
ignored and the last known-good config stays active.

### Hot reload

The config file is re-checked every 5 seconds. These change live:

- `http.api_key` (old key rejected, new key accepted — rotation)
- `http.allowed_origins`

Socket-affecting fields (`host`, `port`, `endpoint`) and `transport`
**require a restart** — the server does not rebind sockets mid-flight.

## Security

- **API key authentication is mandatory for HTTP.** Every request to `/mcp`
  must carry `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; missing/invalid → `401
  Unauthorized` with a generic body (no key material leaked). Comparison is
  constant-time (`subtle`).
- **Origin validation.** Requests with an `Origin` header must match the
  allowlist (`allowed_origins`); invalid → `403 Forbidden`. Requests without
  an `Origin` (non-browser clients) are accepted per MCP protocol semantics.
  Empty allowlist = accept all origins (server still requires the API key).
- **Default bind: `127.0.0.1`** (localhost only), per MCP security
  guidance. If you bind `0.0.0.0` the server logs a warning — the API key is
  still enforced.
- **No permissive CORS by default.** CORS is only as broad as your
  allowlist; wildcard is never used for credentialed requests.
- **API key ≠ TLS.** Authentication is not encryption. Remote deployments
  must sit behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik, Cloudflare
  Tunnel):

```
Internet ──HTTPS──► nginx/Caddy ──► ghostfox :8787 (HTTP localhost)
```

- **`/healthz`** (unauthenticated liveness probe, returns 200) is the only
  endpoint without auth — it exposes no internals and runs no MCP tools.

## Docker

```bash
# HTTP mode inside a container (auth enforced)
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 \
  -e GHOSTFOX_TRANSPORT=http \
  -e GHOSTFOX_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e GHOSTFOX_HTTP_PORT=8787 \
  -e GHOSTFOX_HTTP_API_KEY='change-me' \
  ghcr.io/ras-indo/ghostfox
```

The container default never exposes an unauthenticated MCP server: it
requires `GHOSTFOX_TRANSPORT=http` (or `both`) *and* an API key. The
image is built from the exact release artifacts of the matching version.

## Repository layout

````
runtime/   Rust: ghostcloak-{core,fingerprint,mcp,eval}     (MIT OR Apache-2.0)
engine/    Browser fork: patches, branding, build system    (MPL-2.0)
AGENTS.md  The agent playbook — how AI agents drive Ghostfox like a human
````

Two directories, two licenses, one product. The runtime speaks
[Juggler](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) natively — no Node, no
Python at runtime.

> **Using Ghostfox with an AI agent (opencode, Codex, Cursor, Claude Code,
> ...)?** Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first — it's the distilled playbook
> from real agent runs: the READ → REASON → DECIDE → ACT loop, self-health
> (rate limits, drafts, notifications), rich-editor typing, and every known
> wall with its proven solution.

## Why own the engine?

- **Anti-detect that survives inspection.** Spoofing happens inside the
  engine (navigator, screen, WebGL, fonts, WebRTC, timezone, audio) — not in
  injected JS that detectors can read.
- **No cloud dependency.** Your agent's identities and cookies never touch a
  third-party host.
- **Upstream insurance.** `engine/` tracks [daijro/camoufox](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox)
  as `upstream`; Ghostfox applies its own branding and can rebase whenever it
  wants — including if upstream patches go closed-source.

## Status

v0.7 — alpha. Verified: identity coherence (500/500), full MCP round-trip
E2E (create → open → fill → submit), 8 captcha families E2E on production
sites (bilibili, hCaptcha-protected signups, TikTok), debug cortex
(console/errors/network), Docker image E2E (session → open → snapshot
inside a container), portable sessions across Camoufox-lineage browsers.
Distributed via PyPI, npm, Docker (GHCR) and the official MCP Registry.
Known limits are tracked in the changelogs under `runtime/` and `engine/`.

**Do not use against targets you don't have permission to test.** This is a
testing / research tool.
